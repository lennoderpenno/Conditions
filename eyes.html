    (Eyes)<br>
    You're staying up all night<br>
    She woke you from your slumber<br>
    Hastily, she comes<br>
    To wrap you 'round her finger<br>
    A whole new world<br>
    You're living in a whole new world<br>
    Everything's green, built by machines<br>
    I'll order takeaway<br>
    Discover nature, gazing at stars<br>
    By the side of a motorway<br>
    The city life, this is the life<br>
    You want, you want?<br>
    You've got your eyes on her<br>
    And you can't turn away<br>
    No, you can't turn away<br>
    You've got your eyes on her<br>
    And you can't turn away<br>
    No, you can't turn away<br>
    (Eyes, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)<br>
    (Eyes, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)<br>
    Now is the time when all of this<br>
    Just feels so simple<br>
    Have a drink, fall in love<br>
    Meet new people<br>
    A cog in the wheel<br>
    But such a beautiful wheel<br>
    Violent crime, nothing's on time<br>
    The most creative people<br>
    Concrete, culture, brick and mortar<br>
    Everyone is equal<br>
    The city lights, this is the life<br>
    You want, you want?<br>
    You've got your eyes on her<br>
    And you can't turn away<br>
    No, you can't turn away<br>
    You've got your eyes on her<br>
    And you can't turn away<br>
    No, you can't turn away<br>
    (Eyes, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)<br>
    (Eyes, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)<br>
    (Eyes)<br>
