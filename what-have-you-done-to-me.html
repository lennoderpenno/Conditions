    What have you done to me?<br>
    Sixteen ads by the minute<br>
    I'm all out of energy, of energy<br>
    What have you done to me?<br>
    All these eyes in the shower<br>
    Invading my privacy, my privacy<br>
    
    You don't wanna look too long<br>
    You don't wanna see the other way<br>
    Information selling strong<br>
    Might as well watch me day by day<br>
    I can disconnect my phone<br>
    But you'll find a way to see<br>
    The girls I like, the food I eat<br>
    Everything you want is in a sheet<br>
    
    What have you done to me?<br>
    Can't sleep without your voice<br>
    But I wake up in agony, in agony<br>
    What have you done to me?<br>
    Leave my thoughts in the kitchen<br>
    And keep them away from me<br>
    Away from me<br>
    
    When did it become so grey?<br>
    These days, I only talk to you<br>
    And if you disappear today<br>
    Would the world really know what you do?<br>
    I can't believe the hours I've spent<br>
    And all the things I won't achieve<br>
    Maybe I should throw you away<br>
    Pack up my things and leave<br>
    
    What have you?<br>
    What have you?<br>
    
    What have you done?<br>
    What have you done?<br>
    What have you done to me?<br>
    What have you done to me?<br>
    What have you done?<br>
    What have you done?<br>
    What have you done to me?<br>
    What have you done?<br>
    What have you done?<br>
    What have you done?<br>
    What have you done?<br>
    What have you done to Me?
