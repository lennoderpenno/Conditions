    It's what you can't do<br>
It's what you can't do<br>
It's what you can't<br>
It's what you can't do<br>
It's what you can't do<br>
It's what you can't do<br>

That gets you down<br>
That always gets you down, oh<br>
Yeah, it always comes around<br>
Just to get you down, oh-oh<br>

'Cause you had five short minutes left<br>
To just spend here on your own<br>
But for your life, you can't handle that stress<br>
So you open up your phone<br>

And there it is, the images<br>
Your country's a mess, don't you ever forget<br>
And stop, don't you take another bite<br>
You're killing the climate with your appetite<br>
Oh-oh, the makeup makes their skin shine<br>
You can do it too, one click to order online<br>
Oh but, your ratio is fucked up<br>
Whatever you do, you won't get enough love<br>
Whatever you do, you won't get enough love<br>
Whatever you do, you won't get enough love<br>
Whatever you do, oh<br>

In this life, why is it so hard to have a good time?<br>
I feel the guilt of a generation on my shoulder<br>
In this place, why is it I feel like I'm a disgrace?<br>
Do I deserve to be on this side of the border?<br>
Am I an optimist to think free markets<br>
Could ever really fix this?<br>
Am I a socialist if I lay the blame<br>
At the feet of big business?<br>
But I can't help you, don't wanna talk about it<br>
'Cause I don't wanna be rude, but<br>
The things that have been troubling you<br>
They trouble me too, but there's nothing I can do<br>

And it gets me down<br>
It always gets me down, oh<br>
Oh it, when it comes around<br>
It always seems to get me down<br>
