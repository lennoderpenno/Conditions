    Calling for system change<br>
To let me feel<br>
Livin' in a new age<br>
Na-na-na-na-na, no<br>
So let's be real<br>

Need a life update<br>
A little love patch<br>
Need some social aid<br>
Not an escape hatch<br>
But we're wearing masks<br>
Walking down the street<br>
And our enemy<br>
Our mortality<br>

Calling for system change<br>
We heard it in the alleyway<br>
We're gonna shake things up<br>
Force this town wide awake<br>

'Cause we've had enough<br>
Of all the killing in our name<br>
Is there no stopping now?<br>
Is it so hard to admit<br>
We've turned the wrong way?<br>
Calling for system change<br>
I saw it on a hacker page, yeah<br>
They said, they said, they said<br>
We're gonna beat them at their own game<br>
Won't be ready when it hits them<br>

But we go on and on and on about<br>
All the things we'd do when finally<br>
We are the ones who have<br>
A voice to fix our broken dreams<br>
We go on and on and on about<br>
The facts, the things we think that matter<br>
Leaving what is real behind<br>
But I just have to ask<br>

Why is that boy falling down?<br>
Where is his father to help him now?<br>
Why is that man cursing so?<br>
Bringing us all down, all down<br>
To his level-el-el<br>

Why is that boy falling down?<br>
Where is his father to help him now?<br>
Why is that man cursing so?<br>
Bringing us all down, all down<br>
To his level-el-el<br>

Calling for system change<br>
I heard it everywhere<br>
(Calling for system change)<br>
Change (Change)<br>
Calling for system change<br>
I see it in your hair<br>
(Calling for system change)<br>
Change, change<br>
Change, change, oh!<br>
  </p>
