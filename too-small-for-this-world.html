    Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na<br>
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)<br>
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)<br>

I'm too small for this world, I can feel it<br>
Try to make sense of it all, find some meaning<br>
But it just sneaks away right out the backdoor<br>
And I run after it, trying to catch up<br>

Why do we go so far<br>
To find our place?<br>
Oh-oh, why do I try so hard<br>
To run away?<br>
To run away?<br>
Tell me, now<br>

(Do you feel it too?)<br>
(Do you feel it too?)<br>

I'm too small for this world, I can feel it<br>
I'm too big for my head, tend to get lost inside<br>
Into the bottom of sense, dreaming of everything<br>
Into the bottom of sense, you can deceive me<br>

But why do we go so far<br>
To find our place?<br>
To find our place?<br>
Tell me, now<br>

Why do I try so hard<br>
To run away?<br>
To run away?<br>

I'm too small for this world, I believe it<br>
I'm too small for this world, I can see it clear<br>
Tracing lines in the sand like an insect<br>
Reach with trembling hands, need some energy<br>
Just enough to observe from a distance<br>
I'll be watching from far, from far, from far away<br>

But in this heart of mine<br>
Is a small divine<br>
Tries to give me signs<br>
But I can't figure it out, no<br>
No, no, no, no, no<br>
I'm too small for this world<br>
I'm too small for this world<br>
I'm too small for this world<br>
I'm too small for this world<br>

I'm too small for this world<br>
This world, this world<br>
No, I'm too small for this world<br>
No, oh, oh, oh-oh<br>
Oh, I'm too small for this world<br>
Into atoms, into dust, into dying stuff<br>
Into atoms, into dust, into dying stuff<br>
Into atoms, into dust, into dying stuff<br>
Into atoms, into dust, into dying stuff<br>
Into atoms, into dust, into dying stuff<br>
Into atoms, into dust, into dying stuff<br>
Into atoms, into dust, into dying stuff<br>
Into atoms, into dust, into dying stuff<br>
